# RetroJolt

This is the library we created to embed ROM files on Game Jolt for homebrew support.

It's basically a thin wrapper around [Emularity](https://github.com/db48x/emularity) to make it extremely easy to embed and use. It also includes the JS drivers and config files required for [MAME](https://github.com/mamedev/mame). The JS drivers are built using the [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten) target. The config files are generated by loading the particular driver into MAME, setting the key mapping, and exporting into a `.cfg` file.

View the `scripts` folder to see how the builds are done of the various drivers.

Each system supported must contain a "test" folder with a working example. The ROMs included in the test folder must be free to distribute.
